 **BMK RUBY Version** - This is the RUBY side of the project [BestMovieKolektion] The RUBY side takes care of login,registration, basic structure of the website, mailer for "forgot your passsword ?" and the api. For this project we used Themoviedb api. You can find more details here (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

It works hand in hand with the PHP version. Both projects share the same PostgreSQL Database provided by Heroku that is hosted on AWS.

 **Best Movie Kolektion RUBY** 

Main aspects of the RUBY side.

  - Login and registration.
  - calls and shows data from the api
  - mailer
  - search function
  - PostgreSQL Database

## Live preview
A live version is hosted on http://bestmoviekolektion.herokuapp.com/

It would probably be a good idea you take a look at all the files and change everything accordingly.
